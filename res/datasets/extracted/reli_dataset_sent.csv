"Em a minha opinião crepúsculo é um de os piores livro de a saga , mas o filme é o melhor ... Falando a verdade , não acho a saga crepúsculo tão boa assim , prefiro as crônicas de Nárnia ... Em a minha opinião o que deixa a saga crepúsculo tão emocionate é a personalidade de os vampiros que Stephenie Meyer criou , todo mundo já estava acostumado em ver em os filmes que os vampiros eram criaturas grotescas que matavam pessoas em busca de sangue , e a autora de crepúsculo tornou a idéia de vampiros diferente ... Mas fora isso a saga crepúsculo não tem nada de tão espetacular ... É um romance normal como qualquer outro que vejo ... Não tão normal , em a verdade , ( Por quê não é todo dai que você vê uma garota se apaixonando enlouquecidamenten por um vampiro ) , mas normal em certos padrões ... Eu gosto muito de a Bella ( Isabella Swan ) , ela tem um jeito legal de ser , em a minha opinião ela é uma garota com personalidade forte ... De a família Cullen , quem mais me agrada é a Rosalie , ela também é uma garota de personalidade forte ... Em o filme quem eu mais gosto é a Alice , ela é muito melhor que a Rosalie ... Stephenie Meyer é uma ótima escritora , mas , o melhor livro que ela escreveu foi eclipse ... Em a minha opinião o livro crepúsculo poderia ser bem melhor se tivesse seguido o roteiro de o filme , a adaptação de o livro crepúsculo para o cinema foi muito bem feita , eles deram mais emoção a história , em o livro a história é um pouco sem graça , mas dá pra ler ... Emfim , mesmo não amando freneticamente a saga crepúsculo , e mesmo achando que esta saga não mereçe toda a fama que tem , eu tenho que dizer .
